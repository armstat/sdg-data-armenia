Representative sampling stations are those stations that: 1) have a frequency of measurement sufficient to convey important information on changes in the acidification of the carbonates in the chemical composition of the lake և trends of impacts on water systems; 2) Ensures sufficient data quality and comprehensive metadata information to enable integration with data from other stations in the country.
